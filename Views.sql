-- why have views?
-- we can store away complicated queries and call them easily with views
-- as well, its a useful security feature, imagine you are storing sensitive info
-- in a table, you want to be able to let users access certain tables, but not necessarily
-- all the information in the table
-- example: imagine you had an employee table and the security a view can provide
